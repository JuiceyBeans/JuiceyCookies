I have turned my friends into cookies and put them into a Minecraft mod.


- **Robyn Cookie:** COOKIES SO GOOD THEY LEAVE YOU WANTING TO EAT MORE ðŸ¥°... AND MORE... and more... more...
- **The JuMaLu Cookie:** Contains enough sugar to kill God. Probably don't eat too much of this one
- **The Cookie of Lilirine.:** Fuck around and find out.

<details>
  <summary><b>(SPOILERS!)</b> What the cookies do</summary>
  
  - **Robyn Cookie:** Gives you regeneration and hunger for 3 seconds, but has a 60% chance of getting slowness for 10 seconds
  - **The JuMaLu Cookie:** Gives you speed 3 for 30 seconds but has a 50% chance to give you wither 3 for 5 seconds. Kills you if you eat more than 2 in one hour
  - **The Cookie of Lilirine.:** Literally poisons you. (10 seconds)
